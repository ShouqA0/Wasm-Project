> *From the mark of the past… to the security of the future.*

## 🌾 About the Project

**Wasm (وسم)** is a Saudi national smart platform that reimagines an ancient cultural practice into a modern digital system.

Historically, *Wasm* was used to mark camels and livestock—a symbol of ownership, identity, and trust passed through generations.  
Today, **Wasm transforms that legacy into a digital identity**, protecting personal property and preserving rights through technology.

This project bridges **heritage and innovation**, ensuring that ownership is never lost, forgotten, or disputed.
